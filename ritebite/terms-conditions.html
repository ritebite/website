<b>IP Notice and Take Down Policy</b>
<p>1.	RiteBite has put in place IP Notice and Take Down Policy (" Take Down Policy") so that intellectual property owners could easily report listings that infringe their right to ensure that infringing products are removed from the site, as they erode Buyer and good Seller trust.</p>
<p>2.	Only the intellectual property rights owner can report potentially infringing products or listings through Take Down Policy by way of Notice of infringement in the specified format. If you are not the intellectual property rights owner, you can still help by getting in touch with the rights owner and encouraging them to contact us. (Note: RiteBite does not and cannot verify that Merchants have the right or ability to sell or distribute their listed products. However, RiteBite is committed to ensure that item listings do not infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties once an authorized representative of the rights owner properly reports them to RiteBite.)</p>
